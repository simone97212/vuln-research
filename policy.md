## Timeline

When I found a vulnerability I will:

- contact Vendor's Security Team
- contact PM or CTO/CEO of the affected product if security team doesn't answer in **5 Days**
- I will collaborate with DEV team for testing patches and fixes
- If no answer in another **7 days** I will write a md about vulnerability in this repository to contact a CNA
- Ask for CVE
- Publish CVE-ID if assigned
