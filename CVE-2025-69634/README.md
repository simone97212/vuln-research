# CVE-2025-69634: Privilege Escalation Vulnerability in Dolibarr ERP & CRM 22.0.9

Research and report by **Simone Biondi**

---
Affected product: Dolibarr ERP&CRM

Vulnerability: PrivEsc (HTML injection + CSRF)

Version: 22.0.9 (maybe all before 22*, but not tested)

## Summary

A critical vulnerability was identified in Dolibarr ERP/CRM where:

- **Administrator permission changes** are executed via **HTTP GET**
- The **anti-CSRF token is exposed in the URL**
- Low-privileged users can perform **HTML injection** on notes/fields

When an administrator views the injected content and clicks the link,  
the attacker **immediately gains admin rights**.

## Impact

| Impacted Area | Severity |
|--------------|:-------:|
| Access Control Integrity | Critical |
| Privilege Escalation | Critical |
| Admin Account Takeover | Critical |

### CVSS v3.1 
**9.0 — Critical** (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)

| CWE | Title |
|--------------|:-------:|
| CWE-352 | Cross-Site Request Forgery |
| CWE-598 | Information Exposure in Query Strings |
| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control |

---

## Root Causes

- State-changing actions executed via **GET**
- CSRF token placed in **query string**
- HTML injection in user-controlled fields
- No confirmation before privilege modification

The intersection of these behaviors leads to a **Stored Priv-Esc chain attack**.

## Screenshots

|-----------|-------------|

## Mitigations (suggested to vendor)

- Convert **all permission-changing actions** to POST
- Remove CSRF tokens from URLs (store in POST body)
- Add confirmation dialog on admin permission changes
- Add `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin`
- Additional validation on HTML rendering contexts
